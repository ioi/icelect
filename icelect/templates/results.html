<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>There are {{ num_votes }} votes out of {{ num_voters }} voters.

<h2>Condorcet winner</h2>

<p class=small>
	A strong Condorced winner is the option that beats all other
	options in pairwise matches. In case of ties, there could be
	weak Condorced winners that are not beaten by other options,
	but they can tie with each other.
</p>

{% if condorcet_winner is not none %}
<p>There is a strong Condorcet winner: <b>{{ condorcet_winner }}</b>.</p>
{% elif weak_condorcet_winners %}
<p>There are weak Condorcet winners: <b>{{ weak_condorcet_winners|join(", ") }}.</b></p>
{% else %}
<p>There is no Condorcet winner.</p>
{% endif %}

<h2>Schulze method</h2>

<p class=small>
	It might happen that there is no Condorcet winner, if the beat
	graph contains cycles. In this case, we use the Schulze method
	to determine the winner(s). The Schulze winner is an option that
	is not path-beaten (see below for definition) by any other option.
	If there are path-ties, there can be multiple Schulze winners.
</p>

{% if schulze_winners|length == 1 %}
<p>There is a Schulze winner: <b>{{ schulze_winners[0] }}</b>.</p>
{% else %}
<p>There are multiple Schulze winners: <b>{{ schulze_winners|join(", ") }}</b>.

<h4>Beat counts</h4>

<p class=small>
	For every pair of candidates A in B, we count the ballots in which
	A comes before B. We say that A <em>beats</em> B if A is before B often than
	B before A. We say that A <em>ties</em> with B, both orders are equally frequent.
	A <em>beat graph</em> has options as vertices and beats as directed edges.
</p>

{{ matrix(beats) }}

<h4>Beat strengths</h4>

<p class=small>
	If A beats B, the <em>strength</em> of the beat is the number of ballots
	with A before B minus the number of those with B before A. It provides
	costs to edges of the beat graph.
</p>

{{ matrix(weights) }}

<h4>Path strengths</h4>

<p class=small>
	A <em>beat path</em> is a path in the beat graph. The <em>strength</em> of the
	path is the minimum strength among the path's edges. For each pair of options,
	we find the strongest path. We say that A <em>path-beats</em> B if the strongest
	path from A to B is stronger than the strongest path from B to A.
